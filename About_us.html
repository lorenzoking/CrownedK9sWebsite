          <h3>Who We Are</h3>
          <p>At Crowned K9s, we’re more than just trainers—we’re a family. Founded by Lorenzo and his wife, Jenna, Crowned K9s was built on a passion for helping people lead their dogs with confidence while creating harmony in the home. Our three dogs—mom, dad, and daughter—are an important part of the journey too, joining us in everything we do. You’ll often see them working alongside us, helping new dogs learn, socialize, and thrive.</p>
          <p>We believe that every dog has the potential to be an incredible companion, and every owner deserves to feel empowered with the tools to bring out their dog’s best.</p>

          <h3>What We Do</h3>
          <p>Crowned K9s trains dogs of all breeds, sizes, and temperaments. From puppies just starting out to older dogs working through reactivity or obedience struggles, we provide clear, effective training programs tailored to each dog and family.</p>
          <p>Our approach is built on three pillars:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Communication</strong> – Teaching you and your dog a simple, shared language that builds trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency</strong> – Small steps every day create lasting results.</li>
            <li><strong>Confidence</strong> – Empowering you to lead with clarity so your dog can follow with calm.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Whether through private sessions, transformation training, or board‑and‑train programs, our goal is to give you not just a well‑trained dog, but also the knowledge and confidence to continue growing together long after training ends. At Crowned K9s, training is never just about the dog—it’s about strengthening the bond between you and your best friend.</p>
